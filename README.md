High-resolution WRF simulations for wildland fire

WRF is initialized with 3-km HRRR every morning at 0400 LT and downscaled to 1.33 km horizontal resolution. 10-m wind and 2-m temperature are posted online for 1200-2100 LT. Nearby weather stations can also be toggled on/off. The domain is positioned to support the needs of wildland fire managers, particularly IMETS and FBANS assigned to active incidents.
